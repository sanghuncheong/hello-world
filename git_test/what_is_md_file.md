Q> What is the file format ".md" ?

:wolf: A> The file format ".md" is for the Markdown and widely used in Git for example README.md. 
Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the GitHub platform.
I am going to follow the tutorial 
[link 1](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and
[link 2](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#styling-text)
to learn about it.

**Text bold**
*italic*

Inline code

I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.


Quoting code: You can call out code or a command within a sentence with single backticks.
`git status` or 
```
code1 
code2
code3
```
